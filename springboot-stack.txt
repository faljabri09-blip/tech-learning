springboot stack frontend
Spring Boot primarily functions as a backend framework, providing robust capabilities for building REST APIs, managing business logic, and interacting with 
databases. While it can serve static frontend assets and integrate with templating engines like Thymeleaf for server-side rendering, 
it is not a dedicated frontend framework for building dynamic user interfaces.For building the frontend of a full-stack application with
a Spring Boot backend, the common approach involves using modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries. 

springboot stack backend
A typical backend stack utilizing Spring Boot often includes the following components:
Backend Framework: Spring Boot, built on the Spring Framework, simplifies the creation of stand-alone, production-grade applications using Java
or Kotlin. It offers features like autoconfiguration, embedded servers, and streamlined dependency management.
Programming Language: Java is the primary language used with Spring Boot, though Kotlin is also a popular choice.
Database: A database is essential for data storage and management. Common choices include:
Relational Databases (SQL-based): MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server are used when data relationships are crucial.
NoSQL Databases: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis are employed for flexible data models and scalability in specific use cases.
Data Access Layer: Spring Data JPA, built on Hibernate, simplifies interactions with relational databases by providing abstractions and
utilities for data access.Build Tools: Maven or Gradle are used to manage project dependencies and build processes.
Web Server: Spring Boot includes embedded servers like Tomcat or Jetty, eliminating the need for external server deployment.
APIs: Spring MVC facilitates the development of RESTful APIs for communication with frontend applications.
Containerization (Optional): Docker can be used to containerize the Spring Boot application, ensuring consistent deployment across different 
environments. Cloud Deployment (Optional): Spring Boot applications can be easily deployed to various cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google 
Cloud Platform.


DB 
A Spring Boot "stack" for database interaction typically refers to the combination of technologies used to persist and retrieve data within
a Spring Boot application. This stack commonly includes:
Spring Boot Core: Provides the foundation for building standalone, production-ready Spring applications with minimal configuration.
Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access for relational databases by providing a high-level abstraction over the Jakarta Persistence API (JPA)
and often uses Hibernate as the default JPA provider.
Database Driver: A specific driver for the chosen relational database (e.g., MySQL Connector/J for MySQL, PostgreSQL JDBC Driver for PostgreSQL, H2 for in-memory databases).
Database: The actual database system where data is stored (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, H2, MongoDB for NoSQL).
