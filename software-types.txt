2)web application section

A web application is software that runs in a web browser, accessible over the internet without requiring installation on a user's device.
It allows users to interact with data and perform tasks by sending and receiving information between the browser and a remote server. 
Examples include email, online shopping carts, streaming services, and collaborative tools like Google Docs or Slack. 
 
3)Mobile appliction section

Mobile applications are software programs designed specifically for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.
They allow users to perform specific tasks such as gaming, social networking, shopping, or navigation by interacting with the device's 
hardware and accessing the internet. Mobile apps are distinct from web applications because they are downloaded and installed onto the 
device, optimized for touchscreens, and can leverage device-specific features like a camera or GPS.
 

4) Desktop Applications section

A desktop applications section refers to software programs that are installed and run directly on a user's personal computer or laptop,
unlike web-based applications that run in a browser. They are used for a wide range of tasks, including productivity (like Microsoft Word)
, entertainment (like video games), and utilities (like calendar apps). These applications can be launched from shortcuts on the desktop 
or through the system's application menu.
