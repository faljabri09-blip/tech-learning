A web application is software that runs in a web browser, accessible over the internet without requiring installation on a user's device.
It allows users to interact with data and perform tasks by sending and receiving information between the browser and a remote server. 
Examples include email, online shopping carts, streaming services, and collaborative tools like Google Docs or Slack.
