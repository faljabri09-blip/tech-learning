Web Application

A web application, or web app, is a software application that operates on a remote server and is accessed by users through a web browser
over the internet. Unlike traditional desktop applications that require local installation, web apps function directly within a browser like
Chrome, Safari, or Firefox, providing a platform-independent experience.
