dotnet stack frontend
The .NET stack offers several options for frontend development, allowing developers to choose based on project requirements and preferences.

The .NET stack for backend development primarily revolves around the following components:
1. Programming Language:
C#: This is the core language used for .NET backend development. It is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe language developed by Microsoft.
2. Framework:
ASP.NET Core: This is the primary framework for building web applications and APIs with .NET. It's open-source, cross-platform, and designed for high performance and scalability. Within ASP.NET Core, you'll commonly use:
ASP.NET Core Web API: For building RESTful APIs to serve data to client applications (frontend, mobile apps, etc.).
ASP.NET Core MVC: For building traditional server-rendered web applications with a Model-View-Controller architectural pattern.
3. Data Access:
Entity Framework Core (EF Core): This is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to work with C# objects instead of raw SQL queries. It supports various databases like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more.
4. Development Environment:
Visual Studio: The comprehensive Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from Microsoft, offering powerful tools for coding, debugging, and deploying .NET applications.
Visual Studio Code: A lightweight, cross-platform code editor with extensive extensions for .NET development.
5. Other Key Technologies & Concepts:


DB
The term ".NET stack DB" refers to the database component within a .NET technology stack used for building applications. While .NET itself 
is a platform and framework, it integrates seamlessly with various database systems.
